    <h1>
      Creativity and intelligence
    </h1>

    <p>
      The potential relationship between creativity and intelligence has been of interest since the late 1900s, when a multitude of influential studies – from Getzels &amp; Jackson,[62] Barron,[63] Wallach &amp; Kogan,[64] and Guilford[65] – focused not only on creativity, but also on intelligence. This joint focus highlights both the theoretical and practical importance of the relationship: researchers are interested not only if the constructs are related, but also how and why.[66]
    </p>

    <p>
      There are multiple theories accounting for their relationship, with the 3 main theories as follows:
    </p>


    <ul>
      <li>Threshold Theory – Intelligence is a necessary, but not sufficient condition for creativity. There is a moderate positive relationship between creativity and intelligence until IQ ~120.[63][65]</li>
      <li>Certification Theory – Creativity is not intrinsically related to intelligence. Instead, individuals are required to meet the requisite level intelligence in order to gain a certain level of education/work, which then in turn offers the opportunity to be creative.</li> 
      <li>Displays of creativity are moderated by intelligence.[67]</li>
      <li>Interference Theory – Extremely high intelligence might interfere with creative ability.[68]</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Sternberg and O’Hara[69] proposed a framework of 5 possible relationships between creativity and intelligence:
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>Creativity is a subset of intelligence</li>
      <li>Intelligence is a subset of creativity</li>
      <li>Creativity and intelligence are overlapping constructs</li>
      <li>Creativity and intelligence are part of the same construct (coincident sets)</li>
      <li>Creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs (disjoint sets)</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>
      Creativity as a subset of intelligence
    </h2>

    <p>
      In this relationship model, intelligence is a key component in the development of creativity.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Theories of creativity that include intelligence as a subset of creativity</em>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Sternberg &amp; Lubart’s Investment Theory.[76][77] Using the metaphor of a stock market, they demonstrate that creative thinkers are like good investors – they buy low and sell high (in their ideas). Like under/low-valued stock, creative individuals generate unique ideas that are initially rejected by other people. The creative individual has to persevere, and convince the others of the ideas value. After convincing the others, and thus increasing the ideas value, the creative individual ‘sells high’ by leaving the idea with the other people, and moves onto generating another idea. According to this theory, six distinct, but related elements contribute to successful creativity: intelligence, knowledge, thinking styles, personality, motivation, and environment. Intelligence is just one of the six factors that can either solely, or in conjunction with the other five factors, generate creative thoughts.</li>
      <li>Amabile’s Componential Model of Creativity.[78][79] In this model, there are 3 within-individual components needed for creativity – domain-relevant skills, creativity-relevant processes, and task motivation – and 1 component external to the individual: their surrounding social environment. Creativity requires a confluence of all components. High creativity will result when an individual is: intrinsically motivated, possesses both a high level of domain-relevant skills and has high skills in creative thinking, and is working in a highly creative environment.</li>
      <li>Amusement Park Theoretical Model.[80] In this 4-step theory, both domain-specific and generalist views are integrated into a model of creativity. The researchers make use of the metaphor of the amusement park to demonstrate that within each of these creative levels, intelligence plays a key role:
        <ul>
          <li>To get into the amusement park, there are initial requirements (e.g., time/transport to go to the park). Initial requirements (like intelligence) are necessary, but not sufficient for creativity. They are more like prerequisites for creativity, and if an individual does not possess the basic level of the initial requirement (intelligence), then they will not be able to generate creative thoughts/behaviour.</li>
          <li>Secondly are the subcomponents – general thematic areas – that increase in specificity. Like choosing which type of amusement park to visit (e.g. a zoo or a water park), these areas relate to the areas in which someone could be creative (e.g. poetry).</li>
          <li>Thirdly, there are specific domains. After choosing the type of park to visit e.g. waterpark, you then have to choose which specific park to go to. Within the poetry domain, there are many different types (e.g. free verse, riddles, sonnet, etc.) that have to be selected from.</li>
          <li>Lastly, there are micro-domains. These are the specific tasks that reside within each domain e.g. individual lines in a free verse poem / individual rides at the waterpark.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>
      Creativity and intelligence as overlapping yet distinct constructs
    </h2>

    <p>
      This possible relationship concerns creativity and intelligence as distinct, but intersecting constructs.
    </p>

    <p>
      <em>Theories that include Creativity and Intelligence as Overlapping Yet Distinct Constructs</em>
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Renzulli’s Three-Ring Conception of Giftedness.[81] In this conceptualisation, giftedness occurs as a result from the overlap of above average intellectual ability, creativity, and task commitment. Under this view, creativity and intelligence are distinct constructs, but they do overlap under the correct conditions.</li>
      <li>PASS theory of intelligence. In this theory, the planning component – relating to the ability to solve problems, make decisions and take action – strongly overlaps with the concept of creativity.[82]</li>
      <li>Threshold Theory (TT). A number of previous research findings have suggested that a threshold exists in the relationship between creativity and intelligence – both constructs are moderately positively correlated up to an IQ of ~120. Above this threshold of an IQ of 120, if there is a relationship at all, it is small and weak.[62][63][83] TT posits that a moderate level of intelligence is necessary for creativity.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      In support of the TT, Barron[63][84] reported finding a non-significant correlation between creativity and intelligence in a gifted sample; and a significant correlation in a non-gifted sample. Yamamoto[85] in a sample of secondary school children, reported a significant correlation between creativity and intelligence of <em>r</em> = .3, and reported no significant correlation when the sample consisted of gifted children. Fuchs-Beauchamp et al.[86] in a sample of preschoolers found that creativity and intelligence correlated from <em>r</em> = .19 to <em>r</em> = .49 in the group of children who had an IQ below the threshold; and in the group above the threshold, the correlations were <em>r</em> = &lt;.12. Cho et al.[87] reported a correlation of .40 between creativity and intelligence in the average IQ group of a sample of adolescents and adults; and a correlation of close to <em>r</em> = .0 for the high IQ group. Jauk et al.[88] found support for the TT, but only for measures of creative potential; not creative performance.
    </p>

    <p>
      Much modern day research reports findings against TT. Wai et al.[89] in a study using data from the longitudinal Study of Mathematically Precocious Youth – a cohort of elite students from early adolescence into adulthood – found that differences in SAT scores at age 13 were predictive of creative real-life outcomes 20 years later. Kim’s[90] meta-analysis of 21 studies did not find any supporting evidence for TT, and instead negligible correlations were reported between intelligence, creativity, and divergent thinking both below and above IQ's of 120. Preckel et al.,[91] investigating fluid intelligence and creativity, reported small correlations of <em>r</em> = .3 to <em>r</em> = .4 across all levels of cognitive ability.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Creativity and intelligence as coincident sets
    </h2>

    <p>
      Under this view, researchers posit that there are no differences in the mechanisms underlying creativity in those used in normal problem solving; and in normal problem solving, there is no need for creativity. Thus, creativity and Intelligence (problem solving) are the same thing. Perkins[92] referred to this as the ‘nothing-special’ view.
    </p>

    <p>
      Weisberg &amp; Alba[93] examined problem solving by having participants complete the 9-dot problem (see Thinking outside the box#Nine dots puzzle) – where the participants are asked to connect all 9 dots in the 3 rows of 3 dots using 4 straight lines or less, without lifting their pen or tracing the same line twice. The problem can only be solved if the lines go outside the boundaries of the square of dots. Results demonstrated that even when participants were given this insight, they still found it difficult to solve the problem, thus showing that to successfully complete the task it is not just insight (or creativity) that is required.
    </p>

    <h2>
      Creativity and intelligence as disjoint sets
    </h2>

    <p>
      In this view, creativity and intelligence are completely different, unrelated constructs.
    </p>

    <p>
      Getzels and Jackson[62] administered 5 creativity measures to a group of 449 children from grades 6-12, and compared these test findings to results from previously administered (by the school) IQ tests. They found that the correlation between the creativity measures and IQ was <em>r</em> = .26. The high creativity group scored in the top 20% of the overall creativity measures, but were not included in the top 20% of IQ scorers. The high intelligence group scored the opposite: they scored in the top 20% for IQ, but were outside the top 20% scorers for creativity, thus showing that creativity and intelligence are distinct and unrelated.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, this work has been heavily criticised. Wallach and Kogan[64] highlighted that the creativity measures were not only weakly related to one another (to the extent that they were no more related to one another than they were with IQ), but they seemed to also draw upon non-creative skills. McNemar[94] noted that there were major measurement issues, in that the IQ scores were a mixture from 3 different IQ tests.
    </p>  

    <p>
      Wallach and Kogan[64] administered 5 measures of creativity, each of which resulted in a score for originality and fluency; and 10 measures of general intelligence to 151 5th grade children. These tests were untimed, and given in a game-like manner (aiming to facilitate creativity). Inter-correlations between creativity tests were on average <em>r</em> = .41. Inter-correlations between intelligence measures were on average <em>r</em> = .51 with each other. Creativity tests and intelligence measures correlated <em>r</em> = .09.
