		<p>
			Most ancient cultures, including thinkers of Ancient Greece,[10] Ancient China, and Ancient India,[11] lacked the concept of creativity, seeing art as a form of discovery and not creation. The ancient Greeks had no terms corresponding to "to create" or "creator" except for the expression "<i lang="el">poiein</i>" ("to make"), which only applied to <i lang="el">poiesis</i> (poetry) and to the <i lang="el">poietes</i> (poet, or "maker") who made it. Plato did not believe in art as a form of creation. Asked in The Republic,[12] "Will we say, of a painter, that he makes something?", he answers, "Certainly not, he merely imitates."[10]

			It is commonly argued that the notion of "creativity" originated in Western culture through Christianity, as a matter of divine inspiration.[8] According to the historian Daniel J. Boorstin, "the early Western conception of creativity was the Biblical story of creation given in the Genesis."[13] However, this is not creativity in the modern sense, which did not arise until the Renaissance. In the Judaeo-Christian tradition, creativity was the sole province of God; humans were not considered to have the ability to create something new except as an expression of God's work.[14] A concept similar to that of Christianity existed in Greek culture, for instance, Muses were seen as mediating inspiration from the Gods.[15] Romans and Greeks invoked the concept of an external creative "daemon" (Greek) or "genius" (Latin), linked to the sacred or the divine. However, none of these views are similar to the modern concept of creativity, and the individual was not seen as the cause of creation until the Renaissance.[16] It was during the Renaissance that creativity was first seen, not as a conduit for the divine, but from the abilities of "great men".[16]

		<h2>
			The Enlightenment and after
		</h2>

		<p>
			The rejection of creativity in favor of discovery and the belief that individual creation was a conduit of the divine would dominate the West probably until the Renaissance and even later.[14] The development of the modern concept of creativity begins in the Renaissance, when creation began to be perceived as having originated from the abilities of the individual, and not God. This could be attributed to the leading intellectual movement of the time, aptly named humanism, which developed an intensely human-centric outlook on the world, valuing the intellect and achievement of the individual.[17] From this philosophy arose the Renaissance man (or polymath), an individual who embodies the principals of humanism in their ceaseless courtship with knowledge and creation.[18] One of the most well-known and immensely accomplished examples is Leonardo da Vinci.

			However, this shift was gradual and would not become immediately apparent until the Enlightenment.[16] By the 18th century and the Age of Enlightenment, mention of creativity (notably in aesthetics), linked with the concept of imagination, became more frequent.[19] In the writing of Thomas Hobbes, imagination became a key element of human cognition;[8] William Duff was one of the first to identify imagination as a quality of genius, typifying the separation being made between talent (productive, but breaking no new ground) and genius.[15]

		<p>
			As a direct and independent topic of study, creativity effectively received no attention until the 19th century.[15] Runco and Albert argue that creativity as the subject of proper study began seriously to emerge in the late 19th century with the increased interest in individual differences inspired by the arrival of Darwinism. In particular, they refer to the work of Francis Galton, who through his eugenicist outlook took a keen interest in the heritability of intelligence, with creativity taken as an aspect of genius.[8]

		<p>
			In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, leading mathematicians and scientists such as Hermann von Helmholtz (1896) and Henri Poincaré (1908) began to reflect on and publicly discuss their creative processes.
		</p>

		<h2>
			Twentieth century to the present day
		</h2>

		<p>
			The insights of Poincaré and von Helmholtz were built on in early accounts of the creative process by pioneering theorists such as Graham Wallas[20] and Max Wertheimer. In his work <cite>Art of Thought</cite>, published in 1926, Wallas presented one of the first models of the creative process. In the Wallas stage model, creative insights and illuminations may be explained by a process consisting of 5 stages:
		</p>

		<oL>
			<li><em>preparation</em> (preparatory work on a problem that focuses the individual's mind on the problem and explores the problem's dimensions);</li>
			<li><em>incubation</em> (the creative person gets a "feeling" that a solution is on its way);</li>
			<li><em>illumination</em> or insight (where the creative idea bursts forth from its preconscious processing into conscious awareness);</li>
			<li><em>verification</em> (where the idea is consciously verified, elaborated, and then applied).</li>
		</ol>
		
		<p>
			Wallas' model is often treated as four stages, with "intimation" seen as a sub-stage.
		</p>

		<p>
			Wallas considered creativity to be a legacy of the evolutionary process, which allowed humans to quickly adapt to rapidly changing environments. Simonton[21] provides an updated perspective on this view in his book, <cite>Origins of genius: Darwinian perspectives on creativity</cite>.
		</p>

		<p>
			In 1927, Alfred North Whitehead gave the Gifford Lectures at the University of Edinburgh, later published as <cite>Process and Reality</cite>.[22] He is credited with having coined the term "creativity" to serve as the ultimate category of his metaphysical scheme: "Whitehead actually coined the term – our term, still the preferred currency of exchange among literature, science, and the arts. . . a term that quickly became so popular, so omnipresent, that its invention within living memory, and by Alfred North Whitehead of all people, quickly became occluded".[23]
		</p>

			The formal psychometric measurement of creativity, from the standpoint of orthodox psychological literature, is usually considered to have begun with J. P. Guilford's 1950 address to the American Psychological Association, which helped popularize the topic[24] and focus attention on a scientific approach to conceptualizing creativity. (It should be noted that the London School of Psychology had instigated psychometric studies of creativity as early as 1927 with the work of H. L. Hargreaves into the Faculty of Imagination,[25] but it did not have the same impact.) Statistical analysis led to the recognition of creativity (as measured) as a separate aspect of human cognition to IQ-type intelligence, into which it had previously been subsumed. Guilford's work suggested that above a threshold level of IQ, the relationship between creativity and classically measured intelligence broke down.[26]

		<h2>
			"Four C" model
		</h2>

		<p>
			James C. Kaufman and Beghetto introduced a "four C" model of creativity; <em>mini-c</em> ("transformative learning" involving "personally meaningful interpretations of experiences, actions, and insights"), <em>little-c</em> (everyday problem solving and creative expression), <em>Pro-C</em> (exhibited by people who are professionally or vocationally creative though not necessarily eminent) and <em>Big-C</em> (creativity considered great in the given field). This model was intended to help accommodate models and theories of creativity that stressed competence as an essential component and the historical transformation of a creative domain as the highest mark of creativity. It also, the authors argued, made a useful framework for analyzing creative processes in individuals.[27]
		</p>

		<p>
			The contrast of terms "Big C" and "Little c" has been widely used. Kozbelt, Beghetto and Runco use a little-c/Big-C model to review major theories of creativity.[26] Margaret Boden distinguishes between h-creativity (historical) and p-creativity (personal).[28]
		</p>

		<p>
			Robinson[29] and Anna Craft[30] have focused on creativity in a general population, particularly with respect to education. Craft makes a similar distinction between "high" and "little c" creativity.[30] and cites Ken Robinson as referring to "high" and "democratic" creativity. Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi[31] has defined creativity in terms of those individuals judged to have made significant creative, perhaps domain-changing contributions. Simonton has analysed the career trajectories of eminent creative people in order to map patterns and predictors of creative productivity.[32]
