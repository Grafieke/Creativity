		<h2>
			Creativity quotient
		</h2>

		<p>
			Several attempts have been made to develop a creativity quotient of an individual similar to the intelligence quotient (IQ); however, these have been unsuccessful.[47]
		</p>

		<h2>
			Psychometric approach
		</h2>

		<p>
			J. P. Guilford's group,[38] which pioneered the modern psychometric study of creativity, constructed several tests to measure creativity in 1967:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Plot Titles, where participants are given the plot of a story and asked to write original titles.</li>
			<li>Quick Responses is a word-association test scored for uncommonness.</li>
			<li>Figure Concepts, where participants were given simple drawings of objects and individuals and asked to find qualities or features that are common by two or more drawings; these were scored for uncommonness.</li>
			<li>Unusual Uses is finding unusual uses for common everyday objects such as bricks.</li>
			<li>Remote Associations, where participants are asked to find a word between two given words (e.g. Hand _____ Call)</li>
			<li>Remote Consequences, where participants are asked to generate a list of consequences of unexpected events (e.g. loss of gravity)</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			Building on Guilford's work, Torrance[48] developed the Torrance Tests of Creative Thinking in 1966.[49] They involved simple tests of divergent thinking and other problem-solving skills, which were scored on:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Fluency – The total number of interpretable, meaningful, and relevant ideas generated in response to the stimulus.</li>
			<li>Originality – The statistical rarity of the responses among the test subjects.</li>
			<li>Elaboration – The amount of detail in the responses.</li>
		</ul>

		<p>
			The Creativity Achievement Questionnaire, a self-report test that measures creative achievement across 10 domains, was described in 2005 and shown to be reliable and valid when compared to other measures of creativity and to independent evaluation of creative output.[50]
		</p>

		<p>
			Such tests, sometimes called Divergent Thinking (DT) tests have been both supported[51] and criticized.[52]
		</p>

		<p>
			Considerable progress has been made in automated scoring of divergent thinking tests using semantic approach. When compared to human raters, NLP techniques were shown to be reliable and valid in scoring the originality (when compared to human raters).[53][54] The reported computer programs were able to achieve a correlation of 0.60 and 0.72 respectively to human graders.
		</p>

		<p>
			Semantic networks were also used to devise originality scores that yielded significant correlations with socio-personal measures.[55] Most recently, an NSF-funded[56] team of researchers led by James C. Kaufman and Mark A. Runco[57] combined expertise in creativity research, natural language processing, computational linguistics, and statistical data analysis to devise a scalable system for computerized automated testing (SparcIt Creativity Index Testing system). This system enabled automated scoring of DT tests that is reliable, objective, and scalable, thus addressing most of the issues of DT tests that had been found and reported.[52] The resultant computer system was able to achieve a correlation of 0.73 to human graders.[58]
		</p>

		<h2>
			Social-personality approach
		</h2>

		<p>
			Some researchers have taken a social-personality approach to the measurement of creativity. In these studies, personality traits such as independence of judgement, self-confidence, attraction to complexity, aesthetic orientation, and risk-taking are used as measures of the creativity of individuals.[24] A meta-analysis by Gregory Feist showed that creative people tend to be "more open to new experiences, less conventional and less conscientious, more self-confident, self-accepting, driven, ambitious, dominant, hostile, and impulsive." Openness, conscientiousness, self-acceptance, hostility, and impulsivity had the strongest effects of the traits listed.[59] Within the framework of the Big Five model of personality, some consistent traits have emerged.[60] Openness to experience has been shown to be consistently related to a whole host of different assessments of creativity.[61] Among the other Big Five traits, research has demonstrated subtle differences between different domains of creativity. Compared to non-artists, artists tend to have higher levels of openness to experience and lower levels of conscientiousness, while scientists are more open to experience, conscientious, and higher in the confidence-dominance facets of extraversion compared to non-scientists.[59]
